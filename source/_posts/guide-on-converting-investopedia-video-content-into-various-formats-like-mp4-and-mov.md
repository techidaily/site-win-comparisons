## Guide on Converting Investopedia Video Content Into Various Formats Like MP4 & MOV

### Overview

* I plan to be engaged in investment work in future and so now I am learning some investment courses from Investopedia. One inconvenience is that Investopedia does not allow me to download my purchased course for offline study and it really bothers me. Is there some other methods to download Investopedia online courses for offline purpose? Thanks for your answer.
* I think one financial course is very useful for my speech and I plan to download it and insert one part to my PPT after a little editing. Now the question is how I can download this Investopedia course offline. I can not find any Download button or link on the Investopedia course.

Investopedia is an American website which mainly offers courses for investing and finance education.
