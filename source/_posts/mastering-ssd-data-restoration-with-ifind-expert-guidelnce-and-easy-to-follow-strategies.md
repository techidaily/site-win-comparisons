The full name of SSD is the solid-state drive, It is a storage device that differs from the HDD.

* No mechanical structure inside.
* mainly USES flash memory as a permanent memory.

**Advantages of SSD:**

1. No process of motor acceleration rotation.
2. No magnetic head and random reads are very fast.
3. SSD has a relatively fixed reading speed. because the addressing time is independent of the data storage location, disk fragmentation will not affect the reading time.
4. The writing speed of SSD is fast (based on DRAM), and the I/O operation performance is good, as a result, the performance of the system can be significantly improved.
5. No noise.
6. Low energy consumption and low heat under working condition.
7. Low probability of mechanical errors moreover is not afraid of collision, impact, and vibration.
8. The working temperature range is large.
9. Small physical size.

**The disadvantages of SSD:**

1. High cost and low capacity.
2. Compared with the mechanical hard disk, SSD is more likely to receive some adverse effects of external factors. for example, power failure, magnetic interference, static electricity and so on.
3. Writing lifetime is limited. (based on flash memory)
4. Data is difficult to recover after the hardware failure.
