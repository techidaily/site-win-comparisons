I discover the CSV feature and find it great useful.  
 For example have an list with a few items in one line and an specific delimiter:  
    
	One; Albert; 123  
	Second; Martin; 365  
	No. Three; Timothee; 987  
 Now sometimes you want the columns adjusted for better overview?  
 So use “Edit > Separated Values/Sort > User Defined”  
    
	One;       Albert;   123  
	Second;    Martin;   365  
	No. Three; Timothee; 987  
 If your separator is an coma use CSV, if it is an tab use TSV.  
 Very fine Yutaka! Thanks, thats very useful to me every few weeks!  
 But now i have a few questions:  
 1.) CSV seams not to work with selection, or IOW  
 i want to skip some lines at the top and only CSV  
 some lines below. Can that be improved? (or i would  
 use what i ask now in Q2 below)  
 2.) How can i make the separating stay for ever?  
 Means; i want to add spaces after the last char/sign  
 in each line till the next column to have this alignment stay even after leaving CSV-mode.  
 Or as an more general approach i would like to suggest an feature “Fill with…”  
 “Fill with…” should fill each “non-used position” with an given sign.  
 For example i have tis block:  
One  
	Two  
	Three  
	Four  
	Five  
	Six  
	Seven  
 I want to select that block, call “Fill”, enter an space  
 or an ‘X’ here for better visibility, and would get:  
    
	OneXX  
	TwoXX  
	Three  
	FourX  
	FiveX  
	SixXX  
	Seven  
 Then i could select an CSV column and use “Fill…”  
 I see for spaces i can use Column-Selection for this:  
 – make an one-position selection right after the last sign  
 – type an any sign (the lines are filled up with spaces)  
 – delete that typed sign (the spaces are still there)  
 but this didn’t work in CSV-mode  
 and this works to fill spaces only, not other signs like dots f.ex.  
    
	One;.......Albert;...123  
	Second;....Martin;...365  
	No. Three;.Timothee;.987

 If i use “Separated Values”  
 the columns are nicely aligned  
 at the given delimiter.  
 But how can i insert spaces to  
 have them separated even if i  
 leave “Separated Values” mode?

 Hi Yutaka, unfortunately I have seen no feedback from you about this issue.  
 Don’t you think this would be a nifty enhancement?

+1 for fill with feature. This would mimic the fill column function in apache open office. with the options to fill with a series. I have a complex macro that is unable to complete the task. i have to open the file in open office to fill in some columns with a series of numbers. would be great if i could do it all in em editor and a single macro.  
 i much prefer working with all files even .csv in emeditor than any other program. cheers.

Hello pablo,  
This is already possible. You can open a CSV file and make sure it is a CSV mode, and then convert to Fixed Width Columns.
