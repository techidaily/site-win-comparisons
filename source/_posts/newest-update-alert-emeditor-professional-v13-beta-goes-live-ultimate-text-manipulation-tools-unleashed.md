Today, we are releasing EmEditor Professional v13 beta 5 (12.9.4).  
 Updates from beta 4 include:  
 – The Quick Launch window now includes options and allows you to access a searched dialog box.  
 – Fixed other bugs.  
 Please see EmEditor Professional v13 New Features.

 Notes:  
 Since this is a beta version, there might be some bugs left, and that is normal. Only English and Japanese user interfaces are up-to-date. The Help is not up-to-date.  
 This beta release can be tried with a registration key for v12\. Registration keys for v13 will be different from the keys for v12\. When v13 is released, some customers will need to purchase upgrades. If you purchase v12 now, you will receive a free key for v13 when v13 is released.  
 Thank you for continue using EmEditor!

**1.**  
 I had a configuration named Makefile which had no association. In the new association dialog it was shown as “\*.txt” with unticked checkbox. Now I assigned it to the wildcard:  
**Makefile\***  
 However, in the Open/Save dialogs it still displays “Makefile (\*.txt)”.  
**2.**  
 Suggestion: remember the column widths in the the Quick Launch dialog. By default they are too narrow, so I have to enlarge them, but next time I open the dialog the witdhs are default again.  
**3.**  
 Suggestion: make the drop-down path of the Commands listbox in the Configuration->Keyboard wider than the list itself. For example, there’s a screenshot of how this idea is implemented in Total Commander:

**4.**  
 Since Ctrl+click does not select a word anymore in multi-selection mode, why not use it for adding the clicked cursor position to the multi-selection? I mean, if I want to type in the same word in multiple places, I have to make a number of **non-empty** selections, which means I can only **replace** the text with some other text, not append it. It would be useful if EE allowed to add empty selections (insert points, actually) as well. EE already supports them for vertical selection, but the desired insert points are not always aligned vertically, and multi-selection could be very handy there.  
**5.**  
 A bug similar to reported earlier.  
 Press and hold Ctrl. Start selecting text, then reduce the selection area to empty (return the mouse pointer to the beginning of selection). Release the mouse button, release the Ctrl key. Now press any alphanumeric key. The result is “freezing” of EmEditor window contents, just like in this report.

 What does this means?  
 Where can I see this ‘options’?  
 How am I able to ‘access a searched dialog box’?  
 Please elaborate. Thank you.

 1\. and 2\. will be addressed on Beta 6\. I will also think about 3\. in future versions. Thanks!

 All of these items in this screenshot are either Configuration Properties or Customize. By double-clicking one of these items will take you directly to the corresponding dialog box.  
![](https://www.emeditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/quick-launch-options.png)  
 Notes that these items appear only when you have typed something in the Search text box (in this case “file”).  
 Thanks!

 My assuming is that you want to say:  
 “””  
 Before beta 5 you were able to search  
 for the whole Property dialog as such only.  
 E.g. ‘Tools > Marks Properties’  
 Now you can even search down to the the single options,  
 like ‘Show Spaces’ to find  
 ‘Properties for Current Configuration > Marks > Show Spaces’  
 “””  
 That’s Fine!  
 Do I assume that right here?  
 But that seems not work reliable enough?  
 I can find my example above  
 — by typing ‘show ‘  
 — and also by ‘show s’  
 — but not by using ‘show spaces’ or even ‘show sp’  
 — and not by ‘spaces’ alone  
 which will find only ‘Show **White** Spaces’ among others.  
 Close enough, but…  
 – – –  
 And what means now ‘access a searched dialog box’?  
 Do you refer here to the displayed list  
 in the ‘Quick Launch window’ after typing an expression?  
 \*confused\*  
 – – –  
 Improvement wish:  
 please would you enable the history for the search drop-down edit? (the search field)  
 Because I have no history there (working portable)  
 Thank you.

Hi!!  
 Thanks for keep working hard toward the new version.  
 Recently, or maybe sometimes, I usually use the Keyboard Map (Help > Keyboard Map…) to “Configure and/or See” the shortcut that I need, but I found it’s a bit inconvenient that while “Keyboard Map” window is opening, I can’t do anything in the Emeditor “Main” window unless I closed “Keyboard Map” window first.  
 Many times, that I “forgot” or want to re-map the shortcut key because some of my other programs’ shortcut keys using the SAME in the Emeditor’ shortcuts key, so I have to remap them a lot, and that make me forget it a lot. lol  
**Say it shortly**, I hope you can make the “Keyboard Map” window **separates** from the “Main” window, So I can do anything in the “Main” window while I leave the “Keyboard Map” window opens.  
 Thanks!!!  
 edit:Sorry!! if this shouldn’t be in the Beta section because it also happens with the Main version too, but I think it’s maybe good to post here, so you can put this change into this beta version towards the Next Main version.

While replying to your post in the previous beta topic about my extract text option, I noticed that when doing a find, the latest beta indicates there is one more match then there actually is. Using my example from my other reply – given a document with:  
 abcdefgh  
 bbcdfgt  
 pskdbcdjksh  
 jsjkslkdj  
 jksahoiehw  
 If I do a simple find using “bcd”, EmEditor 13 beta 5 incorrectly indicates 4 matches, instead of 3.

Hi, Deipotent  
 I’ve just tried your examples on both 12.0.11 & 13 beta 5.  
 I’ve got the correct matching, I mean only 3 matches found.  
![](http://s18.postimg.org/6e1jlxczp/2013_04_27_00_19_23.jpg)  
 What else (from your example), did you get when you do find using “bcd”?  
 Cheers!

 I reproduced this issue, and it will be fixed on Beta 6\. Thanks!
